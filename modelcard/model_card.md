# Model Card for Cogitat AI - Occupancy

## Model Details

### Overview
This a decision tree classification model auto-generated using mljar. 
It aims to classify whether a room is occupied or not based on the features light intensity and 
temperature. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of sensor values obtained by the 
digitalhhz infrastructure&#39;s database. The respective query is documented in the Documentation 
section of this Model Card.

### Use Cases

* The infrastructure that provides the data that was used to train this model was 
created by the authors as part of the semester project in the Master degree course Digital Business 
Engineering at the Herman-Hollerith-Center of Reutlingen University in Boeblingen, Germany. 
As the second semester project the authors implemented the pipeline which trains, validates, 
versions, and uses this model. 

The model itself can be used to predict the occupancy of room 026/027 at HHZ.
